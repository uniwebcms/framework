# Uniweb Framework

A web development framework built on separation of concerns. **Content** lives in sites – markdown files and assets. **Foundations** provide the React components that render that content.

This architecture means content teams and developers work independently – content editors compose pages using intuitive components, developers build those components.

## Quick Start

Create a new Uniweb project with a starter template:

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-project --template marketing
```

This creates a complete example with:

- A Foundation showcasing different component patterns
- A demo site with sample pages and content
- Components ranging from fully hardcoded to fully parameterized

Start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project
npm install
npx uniweb start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/sites/main/` to see your site.

**Available templates:** `marketing`, `docs`, `corporate`

> Want to start from scratch? Omit `--template` for a minimal project, then add sites and modules as needed.

## Core Concepts

### Sites and Foundations

- A **site** is your content – pages, assets, and configuration
- A **Foundation** is a collection of React components designed to work together
- A **module** is how Foundations are packaged and delivered to sites

Each site links to one Foundation (local or remote) that provides all the components it needs.

### Content-Driven Rendering

Content is written in markdown with YAML frontmatter that specifies which component to use:

```markdown
---
component: HeroSection
layout: centered
background: dark
---

# Welcome to Our Platform

Discover innovative solutions for your business.
```

At runtime, the Framework connects your content with the appropriate component from your Foundation.

## Workspace Organization

**Single project, multiple workspaces:** One project can contain multiple sites and Foundations as independent workspaces. Ideal when you to share components across Foundations, or test the same content with different Foundations.

**Multiple projects:** Alternatively, create separate projects (repositories) for different sites or Foundations. Ideal for independent versioning, separate teams, or publishing Foundations to the registry.

Both approaches use the same Framework tools. Here's an example of a multi-workspace project:

```
my-project/
├── package.json           # Root package.json with workspace config
├── uniweb.config.js       # Project-level configuration
├── sites/                 # Site workspaces
│   ├── marketing/         # Marketing site
│   └── docs/              # Documentation site
└── src/                   # Component library workspaces
    ├── corporate/         # Corporate design Foundation
    └── documentation/     # Documentation-focused Foundation
```

Each workspace maintains its own dependencies, which are auto-installed based on your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).

## Project Types

**Template Project** (recommended for learning):

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-project --template marketing
```

Includes a Foundation with example components and a demo site with sample content.

**Development Project** (build your own Foundation):

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-project --site demo --module marketing
```

Creates a local Foundation at `src/marketing` for building custom components, plus a demo site for testing.

**Content-Only Project** (uses a remote Foundation):

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-site \
  --site / \
  --module https://modules.uniweb.app/username/marketing
```

Ideal for content teams – no local code, just content management.

**Minimal Project** (add sites/modules as needed):

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-project
```

## Key CLI Commands

```bash
# Inside a project
npx uniweb start              # Development server
npx uniweb page add about     # Create a new page
npx uniweb component add FAQ  # Add component to your Foundation

# Inline help
npx uniweb -h                 # Main help index
npx uniweb page add -h        # Help for 'page add' command

# Publishing (coming soon)
npx uniweb site publish       # Publish your site
npx uniweb module publish     # Publish your Foundation to the registry
```

## Installation Options

**Recommended:** Use `npx` (no installation needed):

```bash
npx @uniwebcms/framework@latest create my-project
```

**Optional:** Install globally for frequent use:

```bash
npm install -g @uniwebcms/framework
uniweb create my-project
```

## Why Uniweb Framework?

**Build plug-and-play Foundations.** Create a Foundation and deploy it across multiple sites. When you update components, all connected sites benefit automatically.

**Components without the complexity.** A lightweight JavaScript engine runs in every site and provides all the typical code – localization, analytics, data fetching, forms, uploads. You just write components that receive preprocessed content and render it.

**Standard React workflow.** Use any packages, styles, or tools you prefer. The Framework scaffolds a normal React project – no vendor lock-in.

**Optional schemas unlock powerful features.** Add component schemas for your user-facing components:

- The local build process uses the component schemas to validate frontmatter options
- The Uniweb App uses a Foundation's schema to integrate its exposed components as native building blocks in its visual editor

### The Power of Specialization

Build one Foundation for a vertical (documentation, marketing, corporate, medical, legal, real estate) and deploy to dozens of client sites. Updates propagate automatically, controlled by per-site versioning policies.

**Developers maintain Foundations.** Build and refine components without managing individual client content.

**Content teams manage content.** Work with Git and Markdown, or use the [Uniweb App](https://uniweb.app) for a professional visual editing experience. Components are built by developers; content teams use them without touching code.

This separation eliminates bottlenecks and lets each team focus on their expertise.

## Deployment

**Publish your Foundation to the registry:**

```bash
npx uniweb module publish
```

Once published, content teams can create sites using your Foundation through the Uniweb App or by linking to your published module URL.

**Deploy your site:**

Use the Uniweb App for integrated hosting, or build and deploy to any static host:

```bash
npx uniweb build
```

The `dist` folder contains everything needed for deployment to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any other static hosting service.

See the [deployment guide](https://docs.framework.uniweb.app/deployment) for detailed options.

## Architecture

### Pre-Configured Development Environment

Site and module workspaces come fully pre-configured with professional development tooling:

- **Modern JavaScript ecosystem**: Webpack, Babel, and ESM module support with zero configuration
- **TypeScript integration**: Complete TypeScript support with optimized tsconfig defaults
- **React development**: Built-in React, JSX processing, and router with automatic React imports
- **Advanced CSS tools**: PostCSS pipeline with Tailwind CSS and essential plugins
- **Core components**: The `@uniwebcms/basic` package provides essential components like Link, Image, Icon, Form, RichText, and more
- **Production optimization**: Automatic minification, tree-shaking, code splitting, and asset optimization
- **Developer experience**: Hot module replacement, detailed error overlays, and source maps

This comprehensive setup eliminates hours of configuration work, allowing you to focus immediately on building components rather than wrestling with build tools. While the default configuration covers most common needs, all aspects can be customized as your project requirements evolve.

### Module Federation

Webpack technology enabling Foundations to load dynamically at runtime and share dependencies with host sites. Allows Foundation updates to propagate instantly – improve your Foundation, and sites get the update on their next page load based on their version strategy.

### Version Strategy

Sites control how Foundation updates are applied: automatic (all updates), minor-only (minor + patch), patch-only (patch only), or pinned (no updates). This configuration is evaluated at runtime, giving sites control over their update stability.

### The Broader Ecosystem

The Uniweb Framework is open source (GPL-3.0) and free to use. The broader Uniweb ecosystem includes:

- **Uniweb App** – Professional visual editor and hosting platform (free for drafts, pay to publish)
- **Foundation Registry** – Publish and share Foundations with licensing options (coming soon)
- **Community** – Open interfaces, examples, and shared best practices

The Framework works standalone or integrates with the full ecosystem as your needs grow.
